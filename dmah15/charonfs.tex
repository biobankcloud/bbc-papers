\section{Sharing Data Between Clusters with CharonFS}
\textsc{Charon} is a cloud-backed file system capable of storing and sharing big data in a secure, reliable, and efficient way using multiple cloud providers and storage repositories. 
It is secure and reliable because it does not require trust on any single entity, and it supports the storage of different types of data in distinct locations to comply with required privacy premises. 
Two distinguishing features of \textsc{Charon} are its serverless design (no client-managed server is required in the cloud) and its efficient management of large files (by employing prefetching, cache, and background writes).
% The complete description of \textsc{Charon} architecture and its internal protocols is available in the Deliverable D4.2 of the BiobankCloud project~\cite{D42}.

Figure~\ref{fig:charon} illustrates a deployment scenario where two biobanks store their data in local repositories, in single public cloud providers, and in a resilient cloud-of-clouds. 
In this scenario, the namespace tree has six nodes: directories \texttt{d1} and \texttt{d2}, and files \texttt{A}, \texttt{B}, \texttt{C}, and \texttt{D}. 
The namespace is maintained in the cloud-of-clouds, together with file \texttt{B}.
File \texttt{D}, less critical, is kept in a single cloud.
File \texttt{A} is stored locally because it cannot leave Biobank 2. 
File \texttt{C} is shared between the two sites (e.g., in the same country), thus being stored in both of them.

The BiobankCloud platform will be able to process data available in the HopsFS, which has a view of all data being stored in a single datacenter.
\textsc{Charon} performs the inter-datacenter tasks and the processes between biobanks and public clouds.
% In the next section, we discuss the integration between these two storage systems and evaluate the most appropriate integration scenario for the BiobankCloud platform.
