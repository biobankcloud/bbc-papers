  Abstract                 = {The need to analyze massive scientific data sets on the one hand and the availability of distributed compute resources with an increasing number of CPU cores on the other hand have promoted the development of a variety of languages and systems for parallel, distributed data analysis. Among them are data-parallel query languages such as Pig Latin or Spark as well as scientific workflow languages such as Swift or Pegasus DAX. While data-parallel query languages focus on the exploitation of data parallelism, scientific workflow languages focus on the integration of external tools and libraries. However, a language that combines easy integration of arbitrary tools, treated as black boxes, with the ability to fully exploit data parallelism does not exist yet. Here, we present Cuneiform, a novel language for large-scale scientific data analysis. We highlight its functionality with respect to a set of desirable features for such languages, introduce its syntax and semantics by example, and show its flexibility and conciseness with use cases, including a complex real-life workflow from the area of genome research. Cuneiform scripts are executed dynamically on the workflow execution platform Hi-WAY which is based on Hadoop YARN. The language Cuneiform, including tool support for programming, workflow visualization, debugging, logging, and provenance-tracing, and the parallel execution engine Hi-WAY are fully implemented.},

  Abstract                 = {Over the last two decades, scientic work ow management systems (SWfMS) have emerged as a means to facilitate the design, execution, and monitoring of reusable scientic data processing pipelines. At the same time, the amounts of data generated in various areas of science outpaced enhancements in computational power and storage capabilities. This is especially true for the life sciences, where new technologies increased the sequencing throughput from kilobytes to terabytes per day. This trend requires current SWfMS to adapt: Native support for parallel work ow execution must be provided to increase performance; dynamically scalable "pay-per-use" compute infrastructures have to be integrated to diminish hardware costs; adaptive scheduling of work ows in distributed compute environments is required to optimize resource utilization. In this survey we give an overview of parallelization techniques for SWfMS, both in theory and in their realization in concrete systems. We nd that current systems leave considerable room for improvement and we propose key advancements to the landscape of SWfMS.},

amount of information, many biobanks are interested in cloud computing capabilities such as on-demand elasticity of computing power and storage capacity. There are several security and privacy requirement\
s mandated by personal data protection legislation which hinder biobanks from migrating big data generated by the \{NGS\} machines. This paper describes the privacy requirements of platform-as-service Bio\
bankClouds according to the European Data Protection Directive (DPD). It identifies several key privacy threats which leave BiobankClouds vulnerable to an attack. This study benefits health-care applicati\

  Abstract                 = {Recent advances in genome sequencing technologies provide unprecedented opportunities to characterize individual genomic landscapes and identify mutations relevant for diagnosis and therapy. Specifically, whole-exome sequencing using next-generation sequencing technologies is gaining popularity in the human genetics community due to the moderate costs, manageable data amounts and straightforward interpretation of analysis results. While whole-exome and, in the near future, whole-genome sequencing are becoming commodities, data analysis still poses significant challenges and led to the development of a plethora of tools supporting specific parts of the analysis workflow or providing a complete solution. Here, we surveyed 205 tools for whole-genome/whole-exome sequencing data analysis supporting five distinct analytical steps: quality assessment, alignment, variant identification, variant annotation and visualization. We report an overview of the functionality, features and specific requirements of the individual tools. We then selected 32 programs for variant identification, variant annotation and visualization, which were subjected to hands-on evaluation using four data sets: one set of exome data from two patients with a rare disease for testing identification of germline mutations, two cancer data sets for testing variant callers for somatic mutations, copy number variations and structural variations, and one semi-synthetic data set for testing identification of copy number variations. Our comprehensive survey and evaluation of NGS tools provides a valuable guideline for human geneticists working on Mendelian disorders, complex diseases and cancers.},
