\section{Related Work}

Our platform covers a broad set of technologies providing components that solve problems in the areas of security in Hadoop, sharing data, parallel data processing, and data management. Here, we focus on related work in the area of parallel data analytics and discuss some general and some domain-specific solutions. In general, research in platforms for large-scale data analysis is flourishing over the last years. General purpose data parallel processing systems like Spark~\cite{Zaharia2010} or Flink~\cite{flink15} support efficient and distributed data analysis, but focus on providing SQL support for querying data. This leads to some design choices that make supporting scientific analysis pipelines (or scientific workflows) rather cumbersome. In contrast, specialized scientific workflow management systems like Taverna, Kepler, or Galaxy, typically neglect the Big Data aspect, i.e., they are not able to scale workflow executions efficiently over large clusters~\cite{Bux2013}. 

The lack of a flexible and open platform for running complex analysis pipelines over large data sets led to the development of a number of highly specialized systems. For instance, tools like Crossbow~\cite{Langmead2009b} perform one specific operation (sequence alignment) in a distributed manner, but cannot be used for any other type of analysis. Also for the most important types of complex analysis, like sequence assembly or mutation detection and evaluation, specialized systems exist. Some very popular systems, like GATK~\cite{McKenna2010}, only support parallelism on a single machine and cannot scale-out to make use of additional computational resources. Technically more advanced solutions like Adam~\cite{adam15}, Halvade~\cite{halvade15}, Seal~\cite{seal11}, and PigSeq~\cite{seqpig14} show much better scaling, but are not general purpose solutions but specifically developed for one type of analysis. Appropriate models of data security and privacy are not supported in any of the systems we are aware of. There are frameworks that enhance Hadoop with access control, such as Apache Ranger that supports attribute-based access control and is general and expressive enough to be applied to most Hadoop services. However, attribute-based access control does not have high enough throughput to support authorization of all HDFS operations at the NameNode or all application requests at the ResourceManager. Overall, we see a clear lack of a flexible, open, secure, and scalable platform for scientific data analysis on large data sets.
