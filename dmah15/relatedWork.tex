There are a couple of frameworks for data parallel processing of genomic data. Adam, Halvade, Seal, PigSeq, Spork?

Arvados is a scale-out platform designed to manage genomic and biomedical data. However, it is based on a custom storage service (Keep) and a custom computation service (Crunch), instead of an open platform such as Hadoop, and has GPLv3 licensing which will limit its use in commercial services.

Hadoop has support for Kerberos to secure services interally within Hadoop. For access control for external users, there are a number of different frameworks available, specialized for different services. Apache Ranger is a general attribute-based access control that could, in theory, be applied to all services. However, existing attribute-based access control solutions cannot scale to process the number of access control requests per second that would be generated by HDFS's NameNode and YARN's ResourceManager. Other access control servcices include Apache Sentry which provides role-based access control (RBAC) for databases and tables in Hive. Finally, Apache Knox provides RBAC for REST APIs that are proxies for Hadoop services, such as HDFS, YARN, MapReduce, and HBase. Apache Knox can also act as a gateway to more than one Hadoop cluster.
