The BiobankCloud platform covers a broad set of technologies providing components that solve problems in the areas of security in Hadoop, sharing data, parallel data processing, and data management.
% We have he Hadoop filesystem (HDFS), to YARN, to the scientific workflow scheduler.

Arvados~\cite{Arvados} is a data management and parallel processing platform for managing genomic and biomedical data. It is, however, not based on Hadoop, and Arvados provides its own scalable services for storage (Keep) and workflow scheduling (Crunch).
% , instead of an open platform such as Hadoop, and has GPLv3 licensing which will limit its use in commercial services.
In the of security in the Hadoop ecosystem, there is support for Kerberos to secue access to internal Hadoop services, while for access control there are a number of alternative authorization frameworks available, most backed by a Lightweigth Directory Access Protocol server. Apache Ranger provides an attribute-based access control server that is general and expressive enough to be applied to most Hadoop services but not performant enough to authorize HDFS operations at the NameNode or application requests at the ResourceManager. Apache Sentry provides role-based access control (RBAC) for databases and tables in Hive, while Apache Knox provides role-based access control (RBAC) for REST APIs that are proxies to Hadoop services, such as HDFS, YARN, MapReduce, and HBase. 
% Apache Knox can also act as a gateway to more than one Hadoop cluster.

There are also a number of frameworks for data parallel processing of genomic data, such as Adam~\cite{adam15}, Halvade~\cite{halvade15}, Seal~\cite{seal11}, and PigSeq~\cite{seqpig14}. These frameworks all provide Hadoop-based solutions for parallelizing scientific workflows and scale when new machines are added to them.
